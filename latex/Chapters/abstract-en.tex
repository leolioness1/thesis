\paragraph{}
Global warming has been a topic of discussion for many decades, however its impact on the thaw of permafrost (frozen ground) and vice-versa has not been very well captured or documented in the past. This may be due to most of permafrost being in the Arctic and similarly vast remote areas, which makes data collection difficult and costly.
\paragraph{}
A partial solution to this problem is the use of Remote Sensing imagery, which isn't novel in documenting the changes in permafrost regions, where it has been widely used for decades. Despite its many benefits, this still required manual inspection of images which could be a slow tedious task for researchers.

Over the last decade, the use of Deep Learning on Remote Sensing imagery has risen in popularity, mainly due to the increased availability and scale of Remote Sensing data. This has been fuelled in the last few years by open-source multi-spectral high spatial resolution data, such as the Sentinel-2 data used in this project.
\paragraph{}
However, the use of Deep Learning for the particular use case of identifying the thaw of permafrost, addressed in this project, has nonetheless not been widely studied. To address this gap, the semantic segmentation model proposed in this project performs pixel-wise classification on the satellite images for the identification of Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTSs), using a U-Net architecture.

By using this technique, this project aims to aid the identification of these landforms in a more automated way and at a larger scale.
Since these landforms can be a proxy for the thaw of permafrost, the hope is that this project can help make progress towards the mitigation of the impact of such a powerful geophysical phenomenon.
